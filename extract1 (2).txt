2025/04/16, 10:55 am - +27 65 970 1250: Meriting Youth Development is pleased to announce the launch of a specialized disabled learnership program, targeting Coloured and Indian female individuals. This 12-month commitment comprises two distinct phases:

*Phase 1: Therapy Component (2-3 months)*

Selected learners will participate in an intensive theory program in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, aimed at enhancing their personal and professional development.

*Phase 2: Practical Component (9-10 months)*

Following the therapy phase, learners will embark on a practical component, where they will apply theoretical knowledge and skills in a real-world setting.

*Stipend and Support*

Throughout the 12-month program, learners will receive a monthly stipend of R4,000 to support their living expenses.

We believe this initiative will empower Coloured and Indian female individuals with disabilities, providing them with valuable skills, experience, and a supportive network to enhance their future prospects.

Good afternoon all.
I hope you are all well.
I have been getting texts from people mostly from this group today 
I am not sure who gave out my personal number to social groups for learnership applications, but giving out a person's number without asking them first is disrespectful  and unethical.
The admin of this group has been sending out my numbers but have not called me to ask for my permission or even verify if this is a legit company before sending out my personal  numbers to strangers.

Kindly delete my numbers from your contacts and this group. 
Any texts  sent to my number will be blocked immediately.
Some of you also have my email address, I am not the hiring manager please  refrain from emailing or texting me.

Apply for learnerships using this email address:  Info@personneladmin.co.za 
If there's learnerships in the  future your applications will be considered ONLY if they are sent to this email address. 

Our Company name is Xtensive ICT academy. 
Our website is www.xtensive.co.za you are free to check our website.
*We currently have no learnerships*


All the best on your applications and future intakes
