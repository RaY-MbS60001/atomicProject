2025/04/26, 8:52 pm - +27 63 667 1000: *When is the best time to send a follow-up email?*

The best time to send a follow up email after applying for a job is two weeks after you applied. You may wish to follow up an application if you didn’t receive confirmation that it was received or if you have not heard if you got an interview after two weeks. 

*Should I follow up if the job posting doesn't specify a deadline?*

Yes, you can follow up on a job application even if the job ad doesn’t specify a deadline. Many recruiters and hiring managers will send a message if you have not been successful, but not all of them will. You might want to send a follow up to clarify the status of your application and whether you are still in consideration for the role.  

*How long should I wait for a response after sending a follow-up email?*

If you don’t receive a response to your follow-up email after you’ve applied for a job, it’s best to wait another week or two before sending a final follow-up. You can also check online to see if the job ad is still posted – if it’s not, it may already have been filled.

1-When dropping off CV's, Monday and Tuesday are perfect day . Reason being most companies bashota by Mondays.

2- Be clean, this one is important. Don't look like your problems.

3- When you get to the store, say for example Jet Store, don't ask the security about the store  hiring, security's don't really know and even If they do chances are that they won't tell you.

4- When you get to the shop, greet the security than pass like you are there to shop, then check for workers the one you think it's approachable. 

5- Ask for the manger.

6-Be polite !! A KEY TO MANY DOORS!

7- First Greet her, then shower her with compliments.  After that then you ask if the company does have any vacancies available,then give her/him your CV.

Come on guys let's help each other out 
All the best ♥️♥️

Learnerships are occupationally directed programmes that consist of both structured theoretical learning and practical workplace experience.

 job try your luck 

Sometimes if you are applying for a job and you don't meet requirements , apply don't be discourage by those requirements , sometimes they are writing them but they are looking for u , seeing the salary is above your qualifications, you may get it or end up be negotiated , I have applied for KFC 5 times after each rejection reason of I don't have maths literacy , that requirements didn't discourage me I kept on applying still no responds but the was a position I didn't expect them to offer me , knowing that I'm very very far with their location , I've missed that opportunities , so nothing must discourage you , you must be a job hunter , don't choose jobs , just because you're interested in learnerships , apprenticeship or internships then you won't apply for permanent position because you don't meet their requirements or don't meet your standard swallow your pride and apply every where 👊

But how can people expect to pay the taxi money while on a private car delivering straight where you are going, waiting for you to do whatever and take you back home?

At least R170 would be fair!

1. Tell them your full name and surname.
2. Your age.
3. Your location 
4. If you have no work experience,  tell them and also add on what you have always wanted to learn, like if it's an admin learnership have small research about it.
If it's a company post, have a little research about it.
Sometimes they ask about your strengths and weaknesses.

2025/07/17, 5:17 pm - +27 74 086 4457: She is not misleading people. When you do 2 plus learnerships and their total income is more than 95k its possible you can owe sars.
2025/07/17, 5:18 pm - +27 76 342 9919: <Media omitted>
2025/07/17, 5:18 pm - +27 74 086 4457: Say that, they should just check if both learnerships combined shouldnt be over 95k
2025/07/17, 5:21 pm - +27 84 884 1091: I did 4 learnership 2023 learnership i made more thsn 120k with 12 month but i was lucky the company i did learnership with submitted figures lower than 2,5k per month which rounded of 22 each then total was 88k

The problem is how much you earn, it is based on what IT3 certificate says since it provided by the company

Sars calculate on that
2025/07/17, 5:22 pm - +27 84 884 1091: No the certificate that a company submitted


That why they ask for sars to use it as evidence of much paye or stipend or income was paid
2025/07/17, 5:22 pm - +27 84 884 1091: It already submitted on sars
2025/07/17, 5:23 pm - +27 84 884 1091: When a company asks the sars, it going to filed
2025/07/17, 5:23 pm - +27 74 086 4457: See your company used fraudulent documents. So you are proving us right. Having multiple learnership will result in one owing sars.
2025/07/17, 5:23 pm - +27 63 886 4520: ×134×7277#
2025/07/17, 5:24 pm - +27 84 884 1091: No it didnt learnership should not exceed 95k per month since stipend are not taxed income

Please do research
Im speaking from experience
2025/07/17, 5:25 pm - +27 74 086 4457: Option 3.

Make sure the number u using to use the ussd is the same number on your sars eFiling.

Also its free
2025/07/17, 5:25 pm - +27 84 884 1091: I have once did a course tax

2025/08/20, 6:51 am - +27 73 986 7603: Oh okay my bad it makes sense if you put it that way cause even if s/he’s terminated the employer is still contributing uif on his or her behalf

Usernames don’t help only to identify scammers but they also help us when a certain person sent something valuable and we need to get it again it’s easy to remember by a username than a number or emojie

Hope this answers you <This message was edited>

2025/09/03, 8:55 am - +27 69 877 9556: Q: Tell us about yourself.
✅ “My name is [your name], I’m from [your area]. I completed my matric in [year] and I’m passionate about gaining practical skills. I applied for this learnership because I want to grow, gain workplace experience, and build a career path. I am hardworking, reliable, and willing to learn.”

Q: Why did you apply for this learnership?
✅ “I applied because I believe Vital College provides the right balance between theory and workplace experience. I want to gain real skills that will prepare me for permanent employment. I also like that Vital College focuses on discipline and growth, which matches my personal values.”

Q: What do you know about Vital College?
✅ “Vital College is an accredited training provider that offers skills programmes and learnerships. They focus on giving young people both classroom training and practical workplace exposure, with a stipend to support us while we learn. I admire that they help bridge the gap between school and employment.”

Q: What are your strengths?
✅ “I am a fast learner, disciplined, and I always respect time and attendance. I can adapt quickly and work well with different people.”

Q: What are your weaknesses?
✅ “Sometimes I take longer to adapt in a new environment, but I’ve been learning to ask questions and get clarity so I can improve quickly.”



Q: Why should we choose you for this learnership?
✅ “You should choose me because I am serious about my future. I will attend every session, respect the rules, and put in effort both in class and in the workplace. I know this opportunity can change my life, and I will not waste it.”

Q: Where do you see yourself in 3–5 years?
✅ “I see myself working in the field where I trained, either with the company that placed me or another employer, and continuing to improve my skills.”

Q: How do you handle mistakes?
✅ “I take responsibility for mistakes, ask for feedback, and make sure I correct them so I don’t repeat the same error.”

Q: What will you do if you struggle to understand something during training?
✅ “I will ask the facilitator or supervisor for clarity, and also revise on my own until I understand. I believe asking questions is part of learning.”

Q: Tell us about a time you solved a problem.
✅ “At school, we had a group project where some members were not cooperating. I suggested dividing the work into smaller tasks and checking in daily. This helped us finish on time.”

Q: How would you deal with a difficult team member?
✅ “I would stay calm and respectful, try to communicate with them, and if the issue continues, involve the facilitator or supervisor instead of fighting.”

Q: If you are given a boring or repetitive task, how will you handle it?
✅ “I will remind myself that every task is part of learning and discipline. I will focus on doing it correctly, because even small tasks teach responsibility.”

Guys there's a new update we need to resign our attendance registers from induction to week 4 so that you can get your stipend with taking out the R100's so we need to fill any gap left on our attendance register so from week 1 to week 4 you populate your signature for 5 days per week so if you guys have someone who can sign for you it's still fine but if not please come and sign🙏🏾
Sorry for this inconvenience
